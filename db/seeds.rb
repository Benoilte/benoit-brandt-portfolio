                               Most times, I had to perform missions abroad on customer sites, these missions could last a few days to a month or more. I was in charge of upgrading, managing the commissioning, training machine operators, and coordinating the commissioning, the production tests, and the restart in production with the customer.\n
                               Regularly, I had to train colleagues from other Bobst entities on the new Register products.\n
                               When I worked in Switzerland, I had to control the installation before sending it to the customer and was responsible for providing technical support to customers or colleagues.
